**Objective:** Research a **front-end library or technology** we haven't covered in class, and use it to build a portfolio project. The goal is to add an additional project to your GitHub that shows off your creativity and front-end development skills.

## Tips & Resources

* Always remember, *"good artists copy, great artists steal"*. Look at well-designed websites and apps and learn from them. Obviously don't make a direct copy, but derive inspiration from those who design well.
* Take a look at these design resources:
  * <a href="https://kuler.adobe.com" target="_blank">Adobe Kuler</a> - browse color schemes
    * While you're there, learn about the basics of <a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/an-introduction-to-color-theory-for-web-designers--webdesign-1437" target="_blank">color theory</a>, an *essential* skill if you want to do front-end web development.
  * <a href="http://subtlepatterns.com" target="_blank">Subtle Patterns</a> - browse patterns to use as backgrounds
  * <a href="https://www.iconfinder.com" target="_blank">Iconfinder</a> - find icons to use in your project
  * <a href="https://www.behance.net/search?field=102" target="_blank">Behance</a> - See what people are designing and what the community thinks

## Requirements

* Use a front-end library or technology we haven't covered in class to create a website or app of your choice.
* Focus on CSS styling and user experience - build something you'd be proud to show others.

## Getting Started

* Fork this repo, and clone it into your `develop` folder on your local machine.

## Submission

* As you make code changes, frequently commit and push to GitHub.
* Once you've finished the assignment and pushed your work to GitHub, make a pull request from your fork to the original repo.
* **You'll be asked to share what you learned with your classmates on Monday morning.**
